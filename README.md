## Why?

I've been doing emoji "costumes" for a long time... like instead of a boring, pedestrian 😱 I'll find a cowboy-scream emoji on [Emoji Supply](https://emoji.supply/kitchen/) and upload it to Slack. Now that AI image generators are pretty good, why not build an app for this?

## Quick Start

First install [Tauri](https://v1.tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/). Then:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key" # can skip this and it will prompt you to enter an API key
npm install
cargo tauri dev
```
